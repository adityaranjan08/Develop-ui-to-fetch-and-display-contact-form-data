## Develop UI to Fetch and Display Contact Form Data: Bridging the Gap

This repository focuses on building a user interface (UI) component that fetches and displays data submitted through a contact form.

**Why is this useful?**

* **Real-time updates:**  Users can see their submitted information displayed on the screen, providing confirmation and potentially reducing errors.
* **Data visualization:** The UI can present contact information in a clear and organized way, making it easier to review or manage.
* **Improved user experience:** Users can see the outcome of their form submission and have a sense of completion.

**What's Included:**

This repository likely contains the code for the UI component that interacts with existing contact form data. The specific details will depend on the chosen development framework. Here are some possibilities:

* **Front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular):** The code might involve components for fetching data using APIs or state management techniques to display the retrieved information.
* **Web development without frameworks:** The code might use vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques to achieve the functionality.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaranjan08/Develop-ui-to-fetch-and-display-contact-form-data.git
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**

   - Install necessary dependencies (likely mentioned in a requirements file or instructions within the code).
   - You might need additional tools depending on the chosen framework (e.g., Node.js and npm for front-end frameworks).

3. **Explore the code:** The codebase will likely consist of UI components responsible for fetching and displaying contact data.

4. **Run the application:**  
   - Follow the instructions within the repository to execute the code and see the UI functionality in action. (This might involve starting a local development server).

**Learning Objectives:**

By working with this repository, you can gain experience in:

* Building UI components to interact with data.
* Potentially using APIs to fetch data from an external source (depending on implementation).
* Understanding how to display data in a user-friendly manner.

**Contribution:**

If you have experience with different UI frameworks or improvements for the UI's functionality, consider contributing through pull requests!
